Database should have place for user to input: food name, amount ordered, amount of orders per order, date order was placed(have autofill based off current date?),date that item should come in (be able to auto set this to a number?), want to use by date, how many pans of it do you get after being processed, how many orders per pan.

Database should have the following hard coded: shelf life for food products = 7 days (today is day 1, so if order recieved on the 1st it needs to be used by the end of day 7th)

User should be able to decrement amount of orders of item. 

Streatch goal user can input each menu item that sells a food product and decrement as needed (many to many relasionship with POS created as well).
