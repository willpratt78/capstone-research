Database should have place for user to input: food name, amount ordered, amount of orders per order, date order was placed(have autofill based off current date?),date that item should come in (be able to auto set this to a number?), want to use by date, how many pans of it do you get after being processed, how many orders per pan.

Database should have the following hard coded: shelf life for food products = 7 days (today is day 1, so if order recieved on the 1st it needs to be used by the end of day 7th)
